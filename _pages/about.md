Hi!

I am Zhengkang Guan, a junior undergraduate student from the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Xiamen University. Currently I am actively seeking opportunities to pursue a **Ph.D. program**.

I have maintained an impressive academic record with an average score of 90.13 and a GPA of 3.75/4. Furthermore, I am honored to be ranked 3rd out of 44 students in my major.

Here is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAPSKkMjKvhtEfXvqOxQHahkqV86snk4/view?usp=share_link).

My research interests primarily lie in the domains of **Causal Inference**, **Causal Discovery**, and **Causal Reasoning (intersections with AI)**. I am eager to delve deeper into these areas during my doctoral studies.

- **Best CV Project** --- *2024 Imperial College Data Science Winter School*
- Using 3D-Net network for segmentation of low-resolution brain tumor MRI images with small sample sizes, achieving a Dice coefficient of 85.4\% on the test set.
- Experiments indicate that commonly used data augmentation methods do not effectively address the challenges posed by small sample sizes and low-resolution, instead leading to a significant increase in training costs.
- We employ a region-restricted normalization approach, which significantly enhances the efficiency of the network.
